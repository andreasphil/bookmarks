## Development

The site is a Preact app built with [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev). Bookmarks are stored in `/data`. To start the server:

```sh
deno task start       # Start development server
```

## Deploy to Deno

Deployment should work out of the box when linking the repository to a project on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com).

## Credits

Apart from the open source packages listed in [import_map.json](import_map.json), Bookmarks uses:

- Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)
- Favicons generated with [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

Thanks 🙏
