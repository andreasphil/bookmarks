> 💡 This project is a playground for tinkering with various technologies, and is re-written every once in a while. Previous versions were built with [Deno](https://github.com/andreasphil/bookmarks/tree/v2.8.0) and [WMR](https://github.com/andreasphil/bookmarks/tree/v1.2.0).

## Development

The site is a React app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and powered by the new [App Router](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs). Bookmarks are stored in `/data`. The following commands are available for developing and running the app:

```sh
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Create a production bundle
npm run start   # Serve the production bundle locally
```

## Deploy to Vercel

Deployment should work out of the box when linking the repository to a project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Credits

Apart from the open source packages listed in [package.json](package.json), Bookmarks uses:

- Favicons generated with [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

Thanks 🙏
