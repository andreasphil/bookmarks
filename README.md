## Development

The site is a Preact app built with [WMR](https://wmr.dev). Bookmarks are stored in `public/data`.

```sh
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm start       # Start development server
npm run build   # Bundle for production
```

## Deploy to Netlify

Deployment to Netlify is configured in the [netlify.toml file](netlify.toml) and should work out of the box.

## Credits

Apart from the open source packages listed in [package.json](package.json), Bookmarks uses:

- Icons from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)
- Favicons generated with [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

Thanks 🙏
